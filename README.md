# MED8 SUI Mini Project - Choco-Boat by Daniel and Tobias
This project is a SUI Mini Project for 8th Semester Medialogy at AAU. It runs in Unity and is designed to work with an Oculus Quest 2.

**To run:**
- Unzip the zip-file.
- Click "Add" in Unity Hub and choose the "MiniProjekt" to create a Unity Project.
- Open the Unity Project.
- If you see a blank scene, navigate to the "Scenes" folder and select "BasicScene"
- Enjoy!

**Controls:**
- Right grab button accelerates the boat.
- Rotating while holding down the right trigger sets the rotation of the boat.

**IMPORTANT:** The default branch is called "FunctioningBranch" and is the working branch. The BrokenBranch does NOT work, as far as we can tell.
