# SUI Mini Project - Choco-Boat by Daniel and Tobias
This project is a SUI Mini Project for 8th Semester Medialogy at AAU. It runs in Unity and is designed to work with an Oculus Quest 2.

**IMPORTANT:** The default branch is called "FunctioningBranch" and is the working branch. The Main branch does NOT work, as far as we can tell.
